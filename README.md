<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin provides support for [Kadena's](https://kadena.io/) Pact smart contract language to the IntelliJ Platform.

_**Warning:** While effort is made to ensure a stable and reliable user experience, this plugin is under heavy 
development and includes features based on the experimental IntelliJ Platform Language Server API._

## What is Kadena?
Kadena is the industry‚Äôs only truly scalable Layer-1 Proof-of-Work blockchain. More to the point, it‚Äôs the only 
blockchain scalable enough to fully replace the global financial system ‚Äî and other legacy centralized systems ‚Äî 
without compromising on speed or security.

With Chainweb, Kadena‚Äôs multi-braided, infinitely scalable blockchain technology, and Pact, our industry-leading smart 
contract language, Kadena transcends the limits of conventional Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains, enabling builders to 
create meaningful solutions to real-world problems.

In other words, Kadena is operating on a whole other layer: Layer H, the Human Layer.

### What is Pact? ü§ù
Pact is a human-readable smart contract language. It allows anyone to write clearly, directly and safely onto a 
blockchain ‚Äî a true innovation for secure and simple smart contract development. Pact will enable you to create 
entirely new business models and on-chain services.

### What is a smart contract? üìë

Smart contracts are like regular, paper contracts, except that their terms are enforced by computer code, instead of 
humans. Imagine if a baseball player received an automatic bonus in his next paycheck because he hit a certain number 
of home runs.

Smart contracts are the next generation of legal contracts. And Pact is the next generation of smart contracts.
