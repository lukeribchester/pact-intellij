<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin provides support for [Kadena's](https://kadena.io/) Pact smart contract language to the IntelliJ Platform.

## What is Pact? 🤝
Pact is a human-readable smart contract language. It allows anyone to write clearly, directly and safely onto a 
blockchain — a true innovation for secure and simple smart contract development. Pact will enable you to create 
entirely new business models and on-chain services.

- [**Get started with Pact**](https://docs.kadena.io/pact/beginner)

### What is a smart contract? 📑

Smart contracts are like regular, paper contracts, except that their terms are enforced by computer code, instead of 
humans. Imagine if a baseball player received an automatic bonus in his next paycheck because he hit a certain number 
of home runs.

Smart contracts are the next generation of legal contracts. And Pact is the next generation of smart contracts.
